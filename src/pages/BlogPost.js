    title: 'The Project Test Strategy',
    content: `
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        An organizational test strategy is typically defined within frameworks like ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3. If such a strategy is absent or incomplete, test management must clarify missing details with stakeholders. The project test strategy, often documented in a test plan, describes the testing approach for a specific project, release, or product. Documentation requirements depend on the testing context.
      </p>
      <h3>Choosing a Test Approach</h3>
      <p>
        The project test strategy details the objectives, resources, schedules, and responsibilities for testing. Key decisions include selecting test levels, types, and techniques for both static and dynamic testing. The selection and combination of these choices significantly impact testing efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, static code analysis might be better for evaluating code maintainability, while performance efficiency might be better tested through scripted system tests. Selecting the best approach requires understanding the organizational test strategy, project context, and other relevant factors.
      </p>
      <h3>Analyzing the Organizational Test Strategy, Project Context, and Other Aspects</h3>
      <p>
        To develop an effective project test strategy, the following factors must be analyzed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain:</strong>  The domain for which the product will be created or modified. Any domain-specific regulations, standards and practices may change the rigor of testing, the documentation required, as well as its level of detail. For example, in pharmaceuticals and medicine, the test approach often emphasizes intensive user acceptance testing focused on risks to patient health, using test cases based on functional user requirements, whereas user acceptance testing for web-based insurance applications might focus on usability and increasing the likelihood of new insurance contracts through A/B-testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Organizational Goals and Quality Characteristics:</strong> Organizational goals can include the need to demonstrate the value of testing and to increase the degree of test automation or quality characteristics of the test process such as the maturity level of the testing or the efficiency of defect detection. These may determine the test levels and test types that need to be adhered to.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Goals and Type:</strong> The project goals (e.g., concerning budget, time, and quality) and the type of project (i.e., customer specific versus market-oriented product development) typically contain constraints and risks, as well as opportunities that affect testing. For example, tight budget and time constraints may require the rigorous use of risk-based testing to prioritize test cases for test execution, while developing of a product specifically for a customer may require tests that cover pre-defined contractual acceptance criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Resources:</strong> Availability of tools, infrastructure, and skilled staff must be considered. Experience-based testing requires domain knowledge, and tool usage might be limited by licenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Development Lifecycle Model:</strong> To determine appropriate test levels, test effort, appropriate entry criteria and exit criteria. A software lifecycle with continuous integration requires more automated testing than one-off development using a waterfall model and therefore, different test types and test techniques may be used.</li>
        <li><strong>Interfaces with Other Systems:</strong> In a system of systems, aligning the testing with other teams or projects and selecting appropriate test levels especially for system integration testing is essential. For example, risk-based testing helps to prioritize and scale system integration testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability of Test Data:</strong> Constraints on the availability of test data, such as the need for anonymized test data from production, or the creation of specific test data that may be difficult to provide and needs to be validated, such as data for AI testing, must be considered. For example, model-based testing can support test data creation and management of test data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The test manager must choose the best combination of test techniques, levels, and types to satisfy the organizational strategy, project context, and testing constraints.
      </p>
      <h3>Definition of Test Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        A test plan should define the scope, objectives, and exit criteria for each test project. This plan can be at the release, project, or iteration level, and should be agreed upon by stakeholders. The objectives should be S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely). Examples of test objectives include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reaching the specified exit criteria within the defined timeframe</li>
        <li>Meeting the quality goals of the organization (e.g., measured as a key performance indicator for the number of claims from customers for a product)</li>
        <li>Complying with rules and regulations of the specific industry</li>
        <li>Ensuring the availability of data to authorized users only (e.g., by access rights)</li>
        <li>Checking the functional completeness, functional correctness, performance, efficiency, portability and security of data migration</li>
        <li>Enhancing the level of test automation,(e.g. for regression or performance tests by a defined percentage)</li>
        <li>Refactoring code successfully and showing it has not introduced new defects (e.g., to remove poorly structured source code or technical debt while maintaining the existing functionality, proven by a regression test)</li>
        <li>Proving the security of interfaces (e.g., by validating Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages against their XML Schema Definition to ensure the rejection of malicious data)</li>
        <li>Checking the usability of a user interface and achieving some degree of sub-characteristic (e.g., by measuring the time it takes to complete a specific task in an online shop)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Apart from the counting and measuring of the project test objectives, the assessment of the quality level by domain level experts and stakeholders should be considered.</p>
      <p>Depending on the project context and test objectives, sometimes multiple test environments with the available resources and/or test tools may be required. The test environments may not all be available at the same time. This needs to be considered when formulating achievable test objectives and exit criteria.</p>
