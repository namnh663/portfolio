            <h2>System Testing</h2>

            <p><strong>System Testing:</strong> Involves testing the complete and fully integrated software product to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> To ensure that the system as a whole works as intended. This includes testing the software for both functional and non-functional requirements to verify that it behaves as expected under varied conditions and handles potential errors gracefully.</p>

            <h3>Types of System Testing</h3>
            <p>System testing encompasses a broad range of testing types to cover all the aspects of the software system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Verifies that the software performs according to its design specifications. This includes testing all features and functionalities against the requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Functional Testing:</strong> Evaluates the system's behavior in areas not covered by functional testing. It includes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Ensures the software meets performance criteria such as response time, reliability, and resource usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Checks for vulnerabilities, security breaches, and data protection mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Assesses the ease of use, user interface, and overall user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatibility Testing:</strong> Examines whether the software works as expected across different browsers, databases, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, and networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Load Testing:</strong> Tests the system's performance under expected and peak load conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Checks to see if new changes have not adversely affected the existing functionalities of the software.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Environment and Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Test Environment:</strong> The system testing phase requires a separate testing environment that closely mimics the production environment to simulate real-world conditions. This includes the hardware, software, and network configurations used by the final product.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Depending on the type of system testing, various automation tools might be used:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Selenium:</strong> For automated web application testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>JMeter:</strong> For performance and load testing.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Test Coverage:</strong> Ensure that all features and functionalities are thoroughly tested.</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Use an environment that accurately reflects the production environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Automate Repetitive Tasks:</strong> Automate tests that are repetitive but necessary, to increase efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Feedback:</strong> Use feedback from the system testing phase to refine the software and improve its quality before it goes to the next phase or is released.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
