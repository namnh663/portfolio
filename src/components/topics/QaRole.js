                <li><strong>Everybody</strong> needs to have a quality-driven thought process.</li>
                <li>The whole team should analyze performance impacts and potential risks of new changes and features <strong>together</strong>.</li>
                <li>The whole team needs to foster a culture of constant collaborationâ€”with testers included in <strong>all discussions</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A whole-team approach is the best way to overcome the strain on time and resources inherent with agile methodology. It's important to shift your team's mindset to "development = coding + testing."
