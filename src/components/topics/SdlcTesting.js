      <h2>Testing throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h2>
      
      <section>
        <h3>1. Requirement Analysis</h3>
        <p>Activities: Review and analyze requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and testable.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Validation and verification of requirements.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Requirement specifications, review reports.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>2. Planning</h3>
        <p>Activities: Develop the overall test strategy, test plan, and test schedule.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Identifying testing scope, objectives, resources, timelines, and deliverables.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Test plan, test strategy documents.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>3. Design</h3>
        <p>Activities: Design the architecture and high-level components of the software.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Reviewing design documents to ensure they meet the requirements and are testable.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Design specifications, review reports.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>4. Implementation (Coding)</h3>
        <p>Activities: Develop the actual source code.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Unit testing of individual components or modules.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Source code, unit test cases, and results.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>5. Integration</h3>
        <p>Activities: Combine individual units or modules to build the overall system.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Integration testing to ensure that modules interact correctly.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Integrated system, integration test cases, and results.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>6. System Testing</h3>
        <p>Activities: Test the complete and integrated software system.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Functional and non-functional testing of the entire system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.</p>
        <p>Outputs: System test cases, test scripts, test results, and defect reports.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h3>
        <p>Activities: Validate the system against user needs and requirements.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Ensuring the system is ready for deployment and meets user expectations.</p>
        <p>Outputs: UAT test cases, test results, and user sign-off.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>8. Deployment</h3>
        <p>Activities: Release the software to the production environment.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Smoke testing or sanity testing to ensure that the deployment is successful and the system works in the production environment.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Deployment reports, smoke test results.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>9. Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Activities: Monitor and maintain the system post-deployment.</p>
        <p>Testing Focus: Regression testing and bug fixing to ensure that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.</p>
        <p>Outputs: Maintenance reports, regression test cases, and results.</p>
      </section>
      
      <h3>Key Points of Testing in SDLC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early and Continuous Testing</strong>: Begin testing activities early in the lifecycle and continue them throughout to detect defects as soon as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Planning and Strategy</strong>: Establish a clear test plan and strategy to guide testing efforts and ensure all aspects of the software are covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Automation</strong>: Implement automation where feasible to improve efficiency and coverage, especially for repetitive and regression tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk-Based Testing</strong>: Focus testing efforts on areas with the highest risk to maximize the impact and efficiency of testing activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong>: Foster strong communication and collaboration between testers, developers, and other stakeholders to ensure alignment and address issues promptly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="important">Integrating testing throughout the SDLC helps ensure that defects are caught early, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them, and ultimately leads to a higher-quality software product.</p>
