      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a dedicated Senior QA Engineer with nearly six years of experience in the software testing field, I have cultivated a deep understanding and expertise in both manual and automated testing. My journey in this industry began during my sophomore year of college, which sparked a passion that has grown ever since. Starting as a manual tester, I quickly leveraged my background in software engineering to excel in automated testing as well.

        Throughout my career, which has been primarily focused on product development companies, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the entire product lifecycle, especially in sectors like finance, banking, and logistics. I take great pride in my ability to work meticulously and responsibly, ensuring all tasks are completed on time and with attention to detail. This trait has consistently earned me commendation from my direct managers.

        My commitment to excellence is not just about fulfilling my roles but also enhancing team capabilities. I habitually document detailed notes and compile them into training materials that become essential resources for onboarding new team members. This methodical approach to knowledge sharing has proven invaluable in maintaining high standards within my teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        My efforts have not only been recognized in terms of accolades, such as the DNA Star Award at Home Credit, but have also led to significant contributions like successfully building and deploying automated test systems for companies like Amanotes, ITL, and Live Payments. These achievements underscore my value in an organization and my philosophy that while personal life can be flexible with emotions, professional endeavors should always be approached with a rational and analytical mindset.
