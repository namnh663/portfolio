      <h2>Writing Test Cases Without Clear Requirements Documentation</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>1. Engage with Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>I would begin by engaging with stakeholders, such as product owners, business analysts, developers, to gather information about the intended functionality and expectations of the system. This helps in understanding the primary objectives and key features.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>2. Analyze Existing Resources</h3>
        <p>I would review any available resources, such as mockups, wireframes, and existing documentation, even if they are not complete. This can provide valuable insights into the expected behavior of the system.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>3. Explore the Application</h3>
        <p>I would interact with the application itself to understand its current functionality. This hands-on exploration helps in identifying key workflows and features that need to be tested.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>4. Create Assumptive Test Cases</h3>
        <p>Based on the information gathered, I would create initial test cases based on assumptions and common use cases. These test cases would cover basic functionality, edge cases, and potential user scenarios.</p>
      </section>

      <h3>5. Review and Validate Assumptions</h3>
      <p>I would review these assumptions and initial test cases with the stakeholders to validate their accuracy and completeness. This collaborative review helps in refining the test cases and ensuring they align with the stakeholdersâ€™ expectations.</p>
      <section>

        <h3>6. Iterate and Refine</h3>
        <p>As the development progresses, I would continuously iterate and refine the test cases based on feedback, additional insights, and any new information that becomes available. This ensures that the test cases remain relevant and comprehensive.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>7. Document the Understanding</h3>
        <p>I would document the gathered requirements and assumptions, creating a reference for future testing and development activities. This documentation can also serve as an informal requirements specification, aiding in communication and consistency.</p>
