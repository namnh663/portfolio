      <h2>Testing for Various Connectivity Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Mobile devices can connect to networks through various methods, including cellular networks (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G), Wi-Fi, and other wireless connections such as NFC or Bluetooth. When testing for connectivity, the following alternatives and conditions should be considered:
      </p>

      <h3>Testing Alternatives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Device Emulators/Simulators:</b> These tools can simulate different network connections and are often included in remote device access services. However, their value is limited as they may not fully replicate real-world conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Setting Up Your Own Mobile Network:</b> This allows support for various connection types and bandwidth manipulation, but it is a very costly option.</li>
        <li><b>Field Testing:</b> This is a more cost-effective alternative but has limitations regarding the reproducibility of tests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Connectivity Testing Conditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Functionality Across Connectivity Modes:</b> Ensure the app functions correctly with different connectivity methods (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth).</li>
        <li><b>Switching Between Modes:</b> Test that switching between connectivity modes (e.g., from Wi-Fi to cellular) does not cause any unexpected behavior or data loss. This includes scenarios where users switch between Wi-Fi networks, cellular networks, or GSM cells, as well as situations where users encounter dead spots with no network or deliberately disconnect (e.g., flight mode).</li>
        <li><b>User Information:</b> Ensure the app provides clear information to the user if functionality is restricted due to limited or no network connection or if bandwidth is low. The message should explain the limitations and their reasons.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, connectivity testing must verify that the app handles different network conditions smoothly, maintains data integrity, and keeps users informed about connectivity-related limitations.
