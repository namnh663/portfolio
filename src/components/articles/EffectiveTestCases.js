      <h2>How to Write Effective Test Cases</h2>
      <p>Writing effective test cases is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of your software. Here are some tips and best practices for writing test cases that are clear, concise, and comprehensive.</p>

      <h3>1. Understand the Requirements</h3>
      <p>Before you start writing test cases, make sure you have a clear understanding of the requirements. This will help you identify what needs to be tested and how to test it.</p>

      <h3>2. Use Clear and Descriptive Titles</h3>
      <p>Each test case should have a clear and descriptive title that summarizes what the test case is about. This makes it easier for anyone reviewing the test cases to understand their purpose.</p>

      <h3>3. Include Detailed Steps</h3>
      <p>Write detailed steps for each test case, including any setup or preconditions required. This ensures that anyone can follow the steps and execute the test case correctly.</p>

      <h3>4. Define Expected Results</h3>
      <p>For each step in the test case, define the expected result. This helps in determining whether the test case has passed or failed.</p>

      <h3>5. Cover Both Positive and Negative Scenarios</h3>
      <p>Make sure to write test cases for both positive and negative scenarios. This helps in identifying potential edge cases and ensuring the software behaves correctly under different conditions.</p>

      <h3>6. Review and Update Regularly</h3>
      <p>Regularly review and update your test cases to ensure they remain relevant and accurate as the software evolves. This helps in maintaining the effectiveness of your test suite.</p>

      <h3>7. Use a Consistent Format</h3>
      <p>Use a consistent format for all your test cases. This makes it easier to read and understand the test cases, and ensures that important information is not missed.</p>
