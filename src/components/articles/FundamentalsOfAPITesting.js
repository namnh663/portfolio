      <h2>Fundamentals of API Testing</h2>

      <h3>1. Understanding APIs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications use to interact with each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Types:</strong> Common API types include REST, SOAP, and GraphQL.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Types of API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Verifying that the API functions correctly and returns the expected results.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Assessing the API's responsiveness, throughput, and stability under various loads.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Ensuring the API is secure from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation Testing:</strong> Checking if the API's design and implementation align with business requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>UI Testing:</strong> Ensuring that the user interface interacts correctly with the API.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime/Error Detection:</strong> Identifying errors, bugs, and performance issues during API execution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Key Components of API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Requests:</strong> The call made to the API, including the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), endpoint, headers, and payload.</li>
        <li><strong>Responses:</strong> The data the API returns, which includes the status code, headers, and body content.</li>
        <li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> The specific paths or URLs where the API is accessible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Common Tools for API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Postman:</strong> A popular tool for developing, testing, and monitoring APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Bruno:</strong> A relatively new tool, known for its speed and efficiency in API testing.</li>
        <li><strong>SoapUI:</strong> A tool used for testing SOAP and REST APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Karate:</strong> An open-source tool for API testing that combines API automation and performance testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Swagger:</strong> A framework for API development that includes testing features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Best Practices in API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Define Clear Requirements:</strong> Understand the API specifications and requirements before starting the tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Automate Testing:</strong> Use tools to automate API testing to save time and reduce manual errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Test for All Possible Scenarios:</strong> Include positive, negative, edge cases, and boundary conditions in your test cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Validate Responses:</strong> Check not just the data but also the status codes, response times, and headers.</li>
        <li><strong>Mocking and Virtualization:</strong> Use mock servers to simulate API responses and test isolated components.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Integrate API tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure regular and automated testing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Challenges in API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex Setup:</strong> Setting up the test environment can be complex, especially for testing multi-layered architectures.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Ensuring that test data is accurate, up-to-date, and cleaned up after tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Managing and testing different versions of APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency on Third-Party APIs:</strong> Handling failures or changes in third-party APIs that your application depends on.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Metrics for API Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> The time taken by the API to respond to a request.</li>
        <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> The number of API calls processed in a given period.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Rate:</strong> The percentage of API calls that fail.</li>
        <li><strong>Uptime:</strong> The availability of the API over time.</li>
      </ul>
